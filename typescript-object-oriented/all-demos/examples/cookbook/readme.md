##Steps to run the application:

####Compiling TypeScript with npm:

1. Run "npm install" at the command-line from the root of the project (where the package.json file lives). 
2. Run "npm start" at the command-line. This will compile all of the TypeScript files and generate .js and .map (for debugging) files. 
A watcher will also be created to monitor any changes in the .ts files. Leave the command-window open while doing development work.
