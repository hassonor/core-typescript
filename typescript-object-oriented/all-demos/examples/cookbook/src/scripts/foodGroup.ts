      TODO (Constructors Exercise) Perform the following steps:
      1. Delete the existing field and property get/set blocks currently in the class.
         You'll be replacing this property with a simpler syntax and using a constructor to assign a value to it.
         Note that you can remove the TODO (Properties Exercise) comments in the code if you'd like.
      2. Add a "name" property that is a string type following the "propertyName: type;" coding style. 
      3. Create a new constructor that accepts "name" as a parameter (string type).
      4. Within the constructor, assign the parameter value to the "name" property.
